Hex Client
==========

When you start :code:`hex_client`, you'll see a menu of actions. If this is your
first time here, you will want to choose SIGNUP, which will allow you to create
your wizard name. Once you have a wizard name, you can start casting spells. Each 
spell you cast gives you more points. You can also get points if other people 
support your spells at http://hex.local. As you gain more points, you will
learn to cast new spells and your spells will last longer.

The hex runs a low-power web-server which :code:`hex_client` connects with. You 
may occasionally have a connection error; usually you can just try again and it 
will work.

Once you are familiar with all the spells you can cast through :code:`hex_client`,
you may want to start casting your own spells. Please see :doc:`writing_more_spells`.
